                    <p>Since ancient times, herbs where appreciated for their pharmaceutical and healing properties. The Father of modern medicine, Hippocrates, is known to have used the power of nature, the essential oils, the herbs and the plant extracts to cure diseases and to find balance for the mind, body and soul. "Nature is the most dominant ruler of all", said Hippocrates. This is exactly the philosophy of APIVITA, for which Hippocrates has been a constant source of inspiration.</p>
                    <p class="mt20">Today, APIVITA once again turns the words of Hippocrates into action and presents a new line of creams with healing herbs; the APIVITA Herbal Creams. The long experience and expertise of APIVITA in the extraction of medicinal herbs, along with the deep knowledge of natural ingredients and their actions, guarantee the effectiveness of its products.</p>
